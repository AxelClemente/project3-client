This project was created in the frame of a Web Development’s bootcamp at Ironhack, for the module 3. This is our final project. 
The requirement of the project: Develop a Full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS).
The name of the application is CityStroll App. This project was inspired by the cultural richness that every student at the cohort has. We are lucky to be part of an international and multicultural cohort, this multiculturalism enhances the ideas to discover the world and thrills the code curiosity.

CityStroll - is a web app that helps you to plan your perfect city getaway with itineraries created by local experts, read traveler reviews and share your own experience. Discover the city's hidden gems, secret spots, and local flavors at your own pace. Say goodbye to generic tours and hello to an authentic and immersive city experience.
A tool to create customized city travels with distance, cost, destinations, and time.
How does it work?
The general user can use the app as a tourist guide and live every city as a local. The logged in user has the authorization of create, read, update and delete the information displayed. In addition, the logged in user can suggest strolls according his/her voyage’s background and experience.
Why did you choose it?
Because we love to travel and we love to discover new spots, not as a tourists but as a real “voyageurs”.
